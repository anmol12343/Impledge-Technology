# Step To solve The Problem 

1) First Take the Input from the file and store it in to the map.

2) After that i check for every word that is compounded or not by breaking them at every index (By Recursion and Backtracking) , if that broken part of word exist in the map , then go to the next index and so on.

3) If index become greater than the length of the word then that word is compounded , otherwise not.

4) If the word is compounded ,then compare that word with previous compounded word and find the longest and second longest compunded word.
